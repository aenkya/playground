Design Patterns Tested
[] Specification Pattern
[] Composite Pattern


Solid Principles Tested
[] Single Responsibility Principle
[] Open Closed Principle
  Open for extension, closed for modification
[] Liskov Substitution Principle.
  The Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP) states that objects of a superclass shall be replaceable with objects of its subclasses without breaking the application. That requires the objects of your subclasses to behave in the same way as the objects of your superclass. In other words, subclasses must extend rather than modify the behavior of base classes.
[] Interface Segregation Principle. Avoid bloating interfaces with methods that are not used by all clients. Instead, create multiple, smaller interfaces that are specific to the functionality required by the client.
[] Dependency Inversion Principle
